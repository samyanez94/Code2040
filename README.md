## About Code2040
Code2040 is a community of Black and Latinx technologists and their allies who are diversifying tech to create a more equitable, inclusive, and prosperous economy.

The Fellows Program builds bridges between top, college-level Black and Latinx computer science students who want to access the Innovation Economy and have been historically overlooked and companies who are in need of this talent.
